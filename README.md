# Severe_Wheater_Events_Project2
### Data

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. It is downloaded from the site:
#### [•Storm Data] (47Mb)


The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

### Assignment

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. The Project uses the database to answer the questions below and show the code for the entire analysis. The analysis consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. 

#### Questions

The data analysis addresses the following questions:

##### 1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
##### 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The report is written to provide basis for decision to prioritize respurces for different types of events without making any specific recommendations.

### Document Layout
•Language: the document is written in English.
•Title: the document's title indicates the data analysis 
•Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there is a synopsis which describes and summarizes the analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.
•There should be a section titled Data Processing which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.
•There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.
•You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
•The analysis document must have at least one figure containing a plot.
•Your analysis must have no more than three figures. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
•You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that echo = TRUE for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
