# Severe_Wheater_Events_Project2
### Data

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. It is downloaded from the site:
#### [•Storm Data] (47Mb)


The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

### Assignment

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. The Project uses the database to answer the questions below and show the code for the entire analysis. The analysis consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. 

#### Questions

The data analysis addresses the following questions:

##### 1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
##### 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The report is written to provide basis for decision to prioritize respurces for different types of events without making any specific recommendations.

### Document Layout
##### • Language: the document is written in English.

##### • Title: the document's title indicates the data analysis 

##### • Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there is a synopsis which describes and summarizes the analysis in at most 10 complete sentences

##### • The Data Processing section describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. The analysis starts from the raw CSV file containing the data. No preprocessing outside the document

##### • The Results section in which the results are presented

##### • The analysis has three figures

##### • All the code for the work is in the analysis document. 

### Publishing  
